### One way ANOVA

ANOVA: Statistical test that is typically used to analyze the difference between means of more than one group

One-way ANOVA: - Uses one independent variable\
- The independent variable should have at least 2 levels (or groups/categories)\
- Used when one wants to test if the variations ( or different levels) of the independent variable have a significant effect on the dependent variable

### Assumptions

1.  Independence of observation: No relationship between observation in each group or between the group themselves
2.  Normally-distributed response variable
3.  Homogeneity of variance
4.  Independent variable should be categorical with at least 2 levels

### Hypothesis

Null: There is no difference among group means

Alternative: At least one group differs significantly from the overall mean of the dependent variable

### Installing Packages

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# install.packages("tidymodels")
# install.packages("datarium")
# install.packages("gt")

```

### Load in Libraries

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false


library(tidymodels)
library(datarium)
library(gt)
```

### Loading in the data

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# We will be using the headache data that is part of the datarium package

str(headache)




```

For these examples we will be looking at the treatment and pain scale The categorical (independent) variable will be treatment while pain-score will be the dependent variable

### Headache Hypothesis

1.  Null hypothesis: There is no difference is group means between treatment and pain scale
2.  Alternative Hypothesis: There is a significant difference between group means in at least 1 of the groups

**SSR:** regression sum of squares

**SSE:** error sum of squares

**SST:** total sum of squares (SST = SSR + SSE)

**df~r~:** regression degrees of freedom (df~r~ = k-1)

**df~e~:** error degrees of freedom (df~e~ = n-k)

**df~t~:** total degrees of freedom (df~t~ = n-1)

-   **k:** total number of groups

-   **n:** total observations

**MSR:** regression mean square (MSR = SSR/df~r~)

**MSE:** error mean square (MSE = SSE/df~e~)

**F:** The F test statistic (F = MSR/MSE)

**p:** The p-value that corresponds to F~dfr, dfe~

$$
F = \frac{variation\ among\ the\ sample\ means }{variation\ among\ individuals\ in\ the\ samples}
$$

-   F must be zero or positive

-   F is zero when all sample means are identical

-   F gets larger as means move further apart

### Visualize the distribution of dependent variable 

-   As seen the dependant variable looks approximately normally distributed

```{r}

hist(headache$pain_score)

```

### Calculate one way ANOVA using base R

```{r}
## Use AOV function to calculate 
# aov is the base r fucntion for ANOVA 
# fun(name of dependent variable ~ name independent variable, data = name of data set)

anova <-aov(pain_score ~ treatment, data = headache)

## Tidy ANOVA output and create a gt table 
anova %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt()
```

The p-value was found to be greater than 0.05, meaning that we failed to reject the null hypothesis

Meaning there is no difference is group means between treatment and pain scale

### Visualize the ANOVA using a boxplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
headache %>% 
  ggplot(aes(treatment, pain_score)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Calculate the observed statistic

```{r}
#| echo: true 
## Calculate the observed statistic
observed_f_statistic <- headache %>% 
  specify(pain_score ~ treatment) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "F")

gt(observed_f_statistic)
```

### Calculate the Null Distribution Simulation

This creates a null distribution by randomly assigning a treatment group to each pain score and calculates the f statistic for each randomly generated group

```{r}
#| echo: true
## generate the null distribution using randomization

null_distribution <- headache %>% 
  specify(pain_score ~ treatment) %>% 
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "F")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
null_distribution %>% 
  visualize(method = "both")+
  shade_p_value(observed_f_statistic,
                direction = "greater")
```

### Get the P-Value for the randomization based empirical F distribution

```{r}
#| echo: true
## calculate the p-value from the observed statistic

p_value <- null_distribution %>% 
  get_p_value(
    obs_stat = observed_f_statistic,
    direction = "greater"
    )
p_value %>% 
  gt()
```

The P -value differs slightly from the true F distribution because it is an approximation.

Based on the observations although we get a p-value greater than 0.05 it would be unlikely that there is no association between pain and treatment

### Tukey HSD Test

For pairwise comparisons between each treatment group

```{r}
#| echo: true

Tukey <- TukeyHSD(anova, conf.level = .95)
Tukey %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  gt()

plot(TukeyHSD(anova, conf.level = .95), las = 2)
```

-   This test shows that there were no significant difference between the groups (all p-values greater than 0.05)

-   The confidence interval includes 0 suggesting no statistical difference between groups
